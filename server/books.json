  "id":"7Mb2fLwa8okC","title":"Great Expectations","author":"Charles Dickens","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publishedDate":"2008-06-12","description":"Perhaps Dickens's best-loved work, Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a young man with few prospects for advancement until a mysterious benefactor allows him to escape the Kent marshes for a more promising life in London. Despite his good fortune, Pip is haunted by figures from his past--the escaped convict Magwitch, the time-withered Miss Havisham, and her proud and beautiful ward, Estella--and in time uncovers not just the origins of his great expectations but the mystery of his own heart. A powerful and moving novel, Great Expectations is suffused with Dickens's memories of the past and its grip on the present, and it raises disturbing questions about the extent to which individuals affect each other's lives. This edition reprints the definitive Clarendon text. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst's new introduction ranges widely across critical issues raised by the novel: its biographical genesis, ideas of origin and progress and what makes a \"gentleman,\" memory, melodrama, and the book's critical reception. The book includes four appendices and the fullest set of critical notes in any mass-market edition. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","pageCount":539,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:dickens&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&dq=inauthor:dickens&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"The story of Pip, and how figures from his past haunt him and in time he uncovers not just the origins of his great expectations but the mystery of his own heart."

According to Virginia Woolf, the goal of the essay 'is simply that it should give pleasure...It should lay us under a spell with its first word, and we should only wake, refreshed, with its last.' One of the best practitioners of the art she analysed so rewardingly, Woolf displayed her essay-writing skills across a wide range of subjects, with all the craftsmanship, substance, and rich allure of her novels. This selection brings together thirty of her best essays, including the famous 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', a clarion call for modern fiction. She discusses the arts of writing and of reading, and the particular role and reputation of women writers. She writes movingly about her father and the art of biography, and of the London scene in the early decades of the twentieth century. Overall, these pieces are as indispensable to an understanding of this great writer as they are enchanting in their own right.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.","pageCount":304,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:George+Orwell&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"A PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick With extraordinary relevance and renewed popularity, George Orwell’s 1984 takes on new life in this edition. “Orwell saw, to his credit, that the act of falsifying reality is only secondarily a way ..."

  "id":"jpWivAEACAAJ","title":"A Life in Letters","author":"F. Scott Fitzgerald","publisher":"Scribner","publishedDate":"1995-05-03","description":"A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary \"jazz age\" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.","pageCount":528,"categories":"Biography & Autobiography","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"In this new collection of F.

To F. Scott Fitzgerald’s bemused narrator, Nick Carraway, Gatsby appears to have emerged out of nowhere, evading questions about his murky past and throwing dazzling parties at his luxurious mansion. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing in the intensity of his new neighbor’s ambition, and his fascination grows when he discovers that Gatsby is obsessed by a long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby’s dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result.

But when she's laid off from her reporting job, she finds herself completely at sea...until the day she receives a beautiful, haunting painting of a young woman standing at the edge of a sugarcane field under a violet sky.

She freezes; it's an image of a book she hasn't seen in sixty-five years--a book she recognizes as the Book of Lost Names. The accompanying article describes the looting of libraries across Europe by the Nazis during World War II--an experience Eva remembers all too well. As a graduate student in 1942, Eva was forced to flee Paris after the arrest of her father, a Polish Jew. Finding refuge in a small mountain town in the Free Zone, she begins forging identity documents for Jewish children fleeing to neutral Switzerland. But erasing people comes with a price, and along with a mysterious, handsome forger named Rémy, Eva decides she must find a way to preserve the real names of the children who are too young to remember who they really are. The records they keep in the Book of Last Names will become even more vital when the Resistance cell they work with is betrayed and Rémy disappears. As the Germans close in, Eva records a last, vital message in the book. Decades later, does she have the strength to seek out its answer--and help reunite those lost during the war?","pageCount":416,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t3crEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t3crEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=t3crEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Kristin+Harmel&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=t3crEAAAQBAJ&dq=Kristin+Harmel&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"The records they keep in the Book of Last Names will become even more vital when the Resistance cell they work with is betrayed and Rémy disappears.

Meet Nina Hill: A young woman supremely confident in her own...shell. The only child of a single mother, Nina has her life just as she wants it: a job in a bookstore, a kick-butt trivia team, a world-class planner and a cat named Phil. If she sometimes suspects there might be more to life than reading, she just shrugs and picks up a new book.

Lilian Girvan has been a single mother for three years—ever since her husband died in a car accident. One mental breakdown and some random suicidal thoughts later, she’s just starting to get the hang of this widow thing. She can now get her two girls to school, show up to work, and watch TV like a pro. The only problem is she’s becoming overwhelmed with being underwhelmed. At least her textbook illustrating job has some perks—like actually being called upon to draw whale genitalia. Oh, and there’s that vegetable-gardening class her boss signed her up for. Apparently, being the chosen illustrator for a series of boutique vegetable guides means getting your hands dirty, literally. Wallowing around in compost on a Saturday morning can’t be much worse than wallowing around in pajamas and self-pity. After recruiting her kids and insanely supportive sister to join her, Lilian shows up at the Los Angeles botanical garden feeling out of her element.

Thus the women of Elm Creek Valley's quilting bee are propelled into the unknown. Constance Wright, married to Abel, a skilled sharpshooter courageous enough to have ventured south to buy his wife's freedom from a Virginia plantation, knows well her husband's certainty that all people, enslaved and free, North and South, need colored men like him to fight for a greater purpose. Sisters-in-law Dorothea Nelson and Charlotte Granger wish safe passage for their learned husbands. Schoolmaster turned farmer Thomas carries Dorothea's Dove in the Window quilt with him. Charlotte's husband, Dr. Jonathan Granger, takes more than a doctor's bag to his post at a field hospital. Alongside the devotion of his wife, pregnant with their second child, Jonathan brings the promise he made to his unrequited love, Gerda Bergstrom: \"My first letter will be to you.\" Together with the other members of the circle, the women support one another through loneliness and fear, and devise an ingenious business plan to keep Water's Ford functioning.

Unable to find a job both practical and fulfilling, she takes a temporary position at Elm Creek Manor helping its reclusive owner Sylvia Compson prepare her family estate for sale and after the death of her estranged sister.

Twenty-five-year-old Alice Paul returns to her native New Jersey after several years on the front lines of the suffrage movement in Great Britain. Weakened from imprisonment and hunger strikes, she is nevertheless determined to invigorate the stagnant suffrage movement in her homeland. Nine states have already granted women voting rights, but only a constitutional amendment will secure the vote for all. To inspire support for the campaign, Alice organizes a magnificent procession down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, the day before the inauguration of President-elect Woodrow Wilson, a firm antisuffragist. Joining the march is thirty-nine-year-old New Yorker Maud Malone, librarian and advocate for women’s and workers’ rights. The daughter of Irish immigrants, Maud has acquired a reputation—and a criminal record—for interrupting politicians’ speeches with pointed questions they’d rather ignore. Civil rights activist and journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett resolves that women of color must also be included in the march—and the proposed amendment. Born into slavery in Mississippi, Ida worries that white suffragists may exclude Black women if it serves their own interests. On March 3, 1913, the glorious march commences, but negligent police allow vast crowds of belligerent men to block the parade route—jeering, shouting threats, assaulting the marchers—endangering not only the success of the demonstration but the women’s very lives. Inspired by actual events, The Women’s March offers a fascinating account of a crucial but little-remembered moment in American history, a turning point in the struggle for women’s rights.","pageCount":413,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Jennifer+Chiaverini&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini returns with The Women’s March, an enthralling historical novel of the women’s suffrage movement inspired by three courageous women who bravely risked their lives and liberty in the ..."

When Christmas Eve comes to Elm Creek Manor, the tenor of the holiday is far from certain. Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt. Begun in seasonal fabrics and patterns, the quilt remains unfinished. Sylvia reveals that the handiwork spans several generations and a quartet of Bergstrom quilters—her great aunt, her mother, her sister, and herself. As she examines the array of quilt blocks each family member contributed but never completed, memories of Christmases past emerge. At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues—joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials—the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II—tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.","pageCount":240,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Chiaverini&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7KmujotBUwwC&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt."

But as they go on a series of college visits, the two begin to realize their visions of the future may not align, and as the secrets they've been keeping from the other slowly come to light, they learn they're not exactly the yin and yang they thought they were. Suddenly, neither one is sure what the next four years hold, or whether they'll be spending them together at all. Combining the unique settings of college visits with a cast that's diverse in race, ability, and socioeconomic class, Just Visiting touches upon the kinds of conversations we fear having with those closest to us, and why the strongest relationships can be the scariest.

But all that changes when her parents are killed in a tragic accident, making her guardian to her two younger brothers. To keep them out of foster care, she'll have to fix up her image, her life, and her GPA-fast. Too bad the only person on campus she can go to for help is her humorless, pedantic Byzantine History TA, Connor Lawson, who isn't exactly Lizzie's biggest fan. But Connor surprises her. Not only is he a great tutor, but he's also a pretty great babysitter. And chauffeur. And listener. And he understands exactly what it's like to be on your own before you're ready. Before long, Lizzie realizes having a responsible-adult type around has its perks... and that she'd like to do some rather irresponsible (but considerably adult) things with him as well. Good thing he's not the kind of guy who'd ever reciprocate. Until he does. Until they turn into far more than teacher and student.

The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or “externalizing” memory. Within a decade, Bix’s new technology, “Own Your Unconscious”—which allows you access to every memory you’ve ever had, and to share your memories in exchange for access to the memories of others—has seduced multitudes. In the world of Egan’s spectacular imagination, there are “counters” who track and exploit desires and there are “eluders,” those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles—from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also a moving testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for connection, family, privacy, and love. “A beautiful exploration of loss, memory, and history” (San Francisco Chronicle), “this is minimalist maximalism. It’s as if Egan compressed a big 19th-century novel onto a flash drive” (The New York Times).","pageCount":352,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Egan&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and ..."

  "id":"MBAtEAAAQBAJ","title":"Understanding Jennifer Egan","author":"Alexander Moran","publisher":"Univ of South Carolina Press","publishedDate":"2021-09-03","description":"Understanding Jennifer Egan is the first book-length study of the novelist, short-story writer, and journalist best known for the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad. Alexander Moran examines each of Egan's varied published works, analyzes how her journalism informs her fiction, excavates her literary and intellectual influences, and considers her place in contemporary fiction. Moran argues that because Egan's fiction is not easily categorized many of her novels have been underappreciated. He proposes a framework for understanding her writing centered on what it means to have, and to write, an \"authentic\" experience. In Emerald City, Egan explores the authenticity of touristic experience; in The Invisible Circus, her focus shifts to the authenticity of historical memory; in Look at Me, The Keep, and A Visit from the Goon Squad, she explores the effects of digital technology on how we understand authentic experience. In the concluding chapter, Moran discusses Egan's 2017 novel Manhattan Beach as a text that explores the authenticity of history and genre while resonating with the instability of the present.","pageCount":152,"categories":"Literary Criticism","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Egan&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"Understanding Jennifer Egan is the first book-length study of the novelist, short-story writer, and journalist best known for the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad."

Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn’t have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents’ sacrifices. She can’t persuade her husband, Gust, to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress. Only with Harriet, their cherubic daughter, does Frida finally attain the perfection expected of her. Harriet may be all she has, but she is just enough. Until Frida has a very bad day. The state has its eye on mothers like Frida. The ones who check their phones, letting their children get injured on the playground; who let their children walk home alone. Because of one moment of poor judgement, a host of government officials will now determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother’s devotion. Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that a bad mother can be redeemed. That she can learn to be good. An “intense” (Oprah Daily), “captivating” (Today) page-turner that is also a transgressive novel of ideas about the perils of “perfect” upper-middle class parenting; the violence enacted upon women by both the state and, at times, one another; the systems that separate families; and the boundlessness of love, The School for Good Mothers introduces, in Frida, an everywoman for the ages.

Jones learned early on to factor “pain calculations” into every plan, every situation. Born with a rare congenital condition called sacral agenesis which affects both her stature and gait, her pain is physical. But there is also the pain of being judged and pitied for her appearance, of being dismissed as “less than.” The way she has been seen—or not seen—has informed her lens on the world her entire life. She resisted this reality by excelling academically and retreating to “the neutral room in her mind” until it passed. But after unexpectedly becoming a mother (in violation of unspoken social taboos about the disabled body), something in her shifts, and Jones sets off on a journey across the globe, reclaiming the spaces she’d been denied, and denied herself. From the bars and domestic spaces of her life in Brooklyn to sculpture gardens in Rome; from film festivals in Utah to a Beyoncé concert in Milan; from a tennis tournament in California to the Killing Fields of Phnom Penh, Jones weaves memory, observation, experience, and aesthetic philosophy to probe the myths underlying our standards of beauty and desirability and interrogates her own complicity in upholding those myths. “Bold, honest, and superbly well-written” (Andre Aciman, author of Call Me By Your Name) Easy Beauty?is the rare memoir that has the power to make you see the world, and your place in it, with new eyes.","pageCount":288,"categories":"Biography & Autobiography","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jessamine+Chan&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"From the bars and domestic spaces of her life in Brooklyn to sculpture gardens in Rome; from film festivals in Utah to a Beyoncé concert in Milan; from a tennis tournament in California to the Killing Fields of Phnom Penh, Jones weaves ..."

But after the girls’ father vanishes, all traces of stability disappear for the family, and the girls retreat into strange worlds of their own mythmaking and isolation. As the sisters both try to survive their increasingly dark and dangerous adolescences, they break apart and reunite repeatedly, orbiting each other like planets.

If they stay in the city, Agnes will die. There is only one alternative: the Wilderness State, the last swath of untouched, protected land, where people have always been forbidden. Until now.

RED CLOCKS is at once a riveting drama, whose mysteries unfold with magnetic energy, and a shattering novel of ideas. In the vein of Margaret Atwood and Eileen Myles, Leni Zumas fearlessly explores the contours of female experience, evoking THE HANDMAID'S TALE for a new millennium. This is a story of resilience, transformation, and hope in tumultuous-even frightening-times.","pageCount":368,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQrhDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQrhDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=MQrhDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jessamine+Chan&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MQrhDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"In this ferociously imaginative novel, abortion is once again illegal in America, in-vitro fertilization is banned, and the Personhood Amendment grants rights of life, liberty, and property to every embryo."
