  "id":"7Mb2fLwa8okC","title":"Great Expectations","author":"Charles Dickens","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publishedDate":"2008-06-12","description":"Perhaps Dickens's best-loved work, Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a young man with few prospects for advancement until a mysterious benefactor allows him to escape the Kent marshes for a more promising life in London. Despite his good fortune, Pip is haunted by figures from his past--the escaped convict Magwitch, the time-withered Miss Havisham, and her proud and beautiful ward, Estella--and in time uncovers not just the origins of his great expectations but the mystery of his own heart. A powerful and moving novel, Great Expectations is suffused with Dickens's memories of the past and its grip on the present, and it raises disturbing questions about the extent to which individuals affect each other's lives. This edition reprints the definitive Clarendon text. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst's new introduction ranges widely across critical issues raised by the novel: its biographical genesis, ideas of origin and progress and what makes a \"gentleman,\" memory, melodrama, and the book's critical reception. The book includes four appendices and the fullest set of critical notes in any mass-market edition. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","pageCount":539,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:dickens&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7Mb2fLwa8okC&dq=inauthor:dickens&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"The story of Pip, and how figures from his past haunt him and in time he uncovers not just the origins of his great expectations but the mystery of his own heart."

According to Virginia Woolf, the goal of the essay 'is simply that it should give pleasure...It should lay us under a spell with its first word, and we should only wake, refreshed, with its last.' One of the best practitioners of the art she analysed so rewardingly, Woolf displayed her essay-writing skills across a wide range of subjects, with all the craftsmanship, substance, and rich allure of her novels. This selection brings together thirty of her best essays, including the famous 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', a clarion call for modern fiction. She discusses the arts of writing and of reading, and the particular role and reputation of women writers. She writes movingly about her father and the art of biography, and of the London scene in the early decades of the twentieth century. Overall, these pieces are as indispensable to an understanding of this great writer as they are enchanting in their own right.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.","pageCount":304,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:George+Orwell&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"A PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick With extraordinary relevance and renewed popularity, George Orwell’s 1984 takes on new life in this edition. “Orwell saw, to his credit, that the act of falsifying reality is only secondarily a way ..."

  "id":"jpWivAEACAAJ","title":"A Life in Letters","author":"F. Scott Fitzgerald","publisher":"Scribner","publishedDate":"1995-05-03","description":"A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary \"jazz age\" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.","pageCount":528,"categories":"Biography & Autobiography","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jpWivAEACAAJ&dq=inauthor:F.+Scott+Fitzgerald&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"In this new collection of F.

To F. Scott Fitzgerald’s bemused narrator, Nick Carraway, Gatsby appears to have emerged out of nowhere, evading questions about his murky past and throwing dazzling parties at his luxurious mansion. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing in the intensity of his new neighbor’s ambition, and his fascination grows when he discovers that Gatsby is obsessed by a long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby’s dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result.

Lilian Girvan has been a single mother for three years—ever since her husband died in a car accident. One mental breakdown and some random suicidal thoughts later, she’s just starting to get the hang of this widow thing. She can now get her two girls to school, show up to work, and watch TV like a pro. The only problem is she’s becoming overwhelmed with being underwhelmed. At least her textbook illustrating job has some perks—like actually being called upon to draw whale genitalia. Oh, and there’s that vegetable-gardening class her boss signed her up for. Apparently, being the chosen illustrator for a series of boutique vegetable guides means getting your hands dirty, literally. Wallowing around in compost on a Saturday morning can’t be much worse than wallowing around in pajamas and self-pity. After recruiting her kids and insanely supportive sister to join her, Lilian shows up at the Los Angeles botanical garden feeling out of her element.

Things are going according to plan for Serena. She’s smart, confident, and just got a kick-ass new job at a top advertising firm in Washington, D.C. Even before her younger sister gets married in a big, traditional wedding, Serena knows her own dreams don’t include marriage or children. But with her mother constantly encouraging her to be more like her sister, Serena can’t understand why her parents refuse to recognize that she and her sister want completely different experiences out of life. A new friendship with her co-worker, Ainsley, comes as a breath of fresh air, challenging Serena’s long-held beliefs about the importance of self-reliance. She’s been so focused on career success that she’s let all of her hobbies and close friendships fall by the wayside.

Manny Dogra is the beautiful young CEO of Breakup, a highly successful company that helps people manage their relationship breakups. As preoccupied as she is with her business, she’s also planning her wedding to handsome architect Adam Jamieson while dealing with the loss of her beloved parents. For reasons Manny has never understood, her mother and father, who were both born in India, always wanted her to become an “All-American” girl. So that’s what she did.

Suddenly, the woman who built an empire encouraging people to be true to themselves is having her own identity crisis. But when an irritating client named Sammy Patel approaches Manny with an odd breakup request, the perfect solution presents itself: If they both agree to certain terms, he’ll give her a crash course in being “Indian” at his brother’s wedding.

Where she’s the somewhat timid, artistic daughter of Iranian immigrants, Magnus is the quintessential British lad. They have little in common, so there’s no way Soraya could ever fall for him. What’s the harm in having some fun as she navigates her postgrad life? And he could give her some distance from her increasingly complicated home life, where things are strained by her father’s struggles, her mother’s unhappiness and her eldest sister’s estrangement under a vague cloud of shame fifteen years earlier. Distracting herself with Magnus is easy at first. But just as Soraya realizes there’s more to Magnus than she thought, long-buried secrets, and hard questions, begin to surface—will any of her relationships survive the truth coming out?

With The Union Quilters, Chiaverini delivers a powerful story of a remarkable group of women coping with changing roles and the extraordinary experiences of the Civil War. In 1862 Water's Ford, Pennsylvania, abolitionism is prevalent, even passionate, so the local men rally to answer Mr. Lincoln's call to arms. Thus the women of Elm Creek Valley's quilting bee are propelled into the unknown. Constance Wright, married to Abel, a skilled sharpshooter courageous enough to have ventured south to buy his wife's freedom from a Virginia plantation, knows well her husband's certainty that all people, enslaved and free, North and South, need colored men like him to fight for a greater purpose. Sisters-in-law Dorothea Nelson and Charlotte Granger wish safe passage for their learned husbands. Schoolmaster turned farmer Thomas carries Dorothea's Dove in the Window quilt with him. Charlotte's husband, Dr. Jonathan Granger, takes more than a doctor's bag to his post at a field hospital. Alongside the devotion of his wife, pregnant with their second child, Jonathan brings the promise he made to his unrequited love, Gerda Bergstrom: \"My first letter will be to you.\" Together with the other members of the circle, the women support one another through loneliness and fear, and devise an ingenious business plan to keep Water's Ford functioning. That plan may forever alter the patchwork of town life in ways that transcend even the ultimate sacrifices of war.","pageCount":352,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ygVlUqCe5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ygVlUqCe5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=_ygVlUqCe5gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Chiaverini&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ygVlUqCe5gC&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"As the women work, hope, and pray, the men they love confront loneliness, boredom, and danger on the battlefield."

When Sarah McClure and her husband, Matt, move to Waterford, Pennsylvania, she hopes to make a fresh start in the small college town. Unable to find a job both practical and fulfilling, she takes a temporary position at Elm Creek Manor helping its reclusive owner Sylvia Compson prepare her family estate for sale and after the death of her estranged sister. Sylvia is also a master quilter and, as part of Sarah’s compensation, offers to share the secrets of her creative gifts with the younger woman. During their lessons, the intricate, varied threads of Sylvia’s life begin to emerge. It is the story of a young wife living through the hardships and agonies of the World War II home front; of a family torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; of misunderstanding, loss, and a tragedy that can never be undone. As the bond between them deepens, Sarah resolves to help Sylvia free herself from remembered sorrows and restore her life—and her home—to its former glory. In the process, she confronts painful truths about her own family, even as she creates new dreams for the future.

Twenty-five-year-old Alice Paul returns to her native New Jersey after several years on the front lines of the suffrage movement in Great Britain. Weakened from imprisonment and hunger strikes, she is nevertheless determined to invigorate the stagnant suffrage movement in her homeland. Nine states have already granted women voting rights, but only a constitutional amendment will secure the vote for all. To inspire support for the campaign, Alice organizes a magnificent procession down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, the day before the inauguration of President-elect Woodrow Wilson, a firm antisuffragist. Joining the march is thirty-nine-year-old New Yorker Maud Malone, librarian and advocate for women’s and workers’ rights. The daughter of Irish immigrants, Maud has acquired a reputation—and a criminal record—for interrupting politicians’ speeches with pointed questions they’d rather ignore. Civil rights activist and journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett resolves that women of color must also be included in the march—and the proposed amendment. Born into slavery in Mississippi, Ida worries that white suffragists may exclude Black women if it serves their own interests. On March 3, 1913, the glorious march commences, but negligent police allow vast crowds of belligerent men to block the parade route—jeering, shouting threats, assaulting the marchers—endangering not only the success of the demonstration but the women’s very lives. Inspired by actual events, The Women’s March offers a fascinating account of a crucial but little-remembered moment in American history, a turning point in the struggle for women’s rights.","pageCount":413,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Jennifer+Chiaverini&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uR8FEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini returns with The Women’s March, an enthralling historical novel of the women’s suffrage movement inspired by three courageous women who bravely risked their lives and liberty in the ..."

When Christmas Eve comes to Elm Creek Manor, the tenor of the holiday is far from certain. Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt. Begun in seasonal fabrics and patterns, the quilt remains unfinished. Sylvia reveals that the handiwork spans several generations and a quartet of Bergstrom quilters—her great aunt, her mother, her sister, and herself. As she examines the array of quilt blocks each family member contributed but never completed, memories of Christmases past emerge. At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues—joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials—the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II—tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.","pageCount":240,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=7KmujotBUwwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Chiaverini&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7KmujotBUwwC&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt."

But all that changes when her parents are killed in a tragic accident, making her guardian to her two younger brothers. To keep them out of foster care, she'll have to fix up her image, her life, and her GPA-fast. Too bad the only person on campus she can go to for help is her humorless, pedantic Byzantine History TA, Connor Lawson, who isn't exactly Lizzie's biggest fan. But Connor surprises her. Not only is he a great tutor, but he's also a pretty great babysitter. And chauffeur. And listener. And he understands exactly what it's like to be on your own before you're ready.

The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or “externalizing” memory. Within a decade, Bix’s new technology, “Own Your Unconscious”—which allows you access to every memory you’ve ever had, and to share your memories in exchange for access to the memories of others—has seduced multitudes. In the world of Egan’s spectacular imagination, there are “counters” who track and exploit desires and there are “eluders,” those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles—from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also a moving testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for connection, family, privacy, and love. “A beautiful exploration of loss, memory, and history” (San Francisco Chronicle), “this is minimalist maximalism. It’s as if Egan compressed a big 19th-century novel onto a flash drive” (The New York Times).","pageCount":352,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Egan&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-Fo1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and ..."

Alexander Moran examines each of Egan's varied published works, analyzes how her journalism informs her fiction, excavates her literary and intellectual influences, and considers her place in contemporary fiction. Moran argues that because Egan's fiction is not easily categorized many of her novels have been underappreciated. He proposes a framework for understanding her writing centered on what it means to have, and to write, an \"authentic\" experience. In Emerald City, Egan explores the authenticity of touristic experience; in The Invisible Circus, her focus shifts to the authenticity of historical memory; in Look at Me, The Keep, and A Visit from the Goon Squad, she explores the effects of digital technology on how we understand authentic experience. In the concluding chapter, Moran discusses Egan's 2017 novel Manhattan Beach as a text that explores the authenticity of history and genre while resonating with the instability of the present.","pageCount":152,"categories":"Literary Criticism","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jennifer+Egan&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MBAtEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"Understanding Jennifer Egan is the first book-length study of the novelist, short-story writer, and journalist best known for the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad."

Masterfully plotted and deeply moving, this visionary novel folds back on itself like a hall of mirrors to explore just what connects us to one another, and how many extraordinary contingencies bring us to each ordinary day of our lives.” —Esquire From the acclaimed, bestselling author of Station Eleven and The Glass Hotel, a “bold and exciting” (The Economist) and “transcendent” (Wall Street Journal) novel filled with “puncturing emotional truths” (Glamour) In this captivating tale of imagination and ambition, a seemingly disparate array of people come into contact with a time traveller who must resist the pull to change the past and the future. The cast includes a British exile on the west coast of Canada in the early 1900s; the author of a bestselling novel about a fictional pandemic who embarks on a galaxy-spanning book tour during the outbreak of an actual pandemic; a resident of a moon colony almost 300 years in the future; and a lonely girl who films an old-growth forest and experiences a disruption in the recording. Blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, Emily St. John Mandel’s dazzling story follows these engrossing characters across space and time as their lives ultimately intersect. Sea of Tranquility is a breathtaking and wondrous examination of the ties that bind us together, by a master storyteller.","pageCount":220,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Knc4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Knc4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=Knc4EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Emily+St.+John+Mandel&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Knc4EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":".

Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn’t have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents’ sacrifices. She can’t persuade her husband, Gust, to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress. Only with Harriet, their cherubic daughter, does Frida finally attain the perfection expected of her. Harriet may be all she has, but she is just enough. Until Frida has a very bad day. The state has its eye on mothers like Frida. The ones who check their phones, letting their children get injured on the playground; who let their children walk home alone. Because of one moment of poor judgement, a host of government officials will now determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother’s devotion. Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that a bad mother can be redeemed. That she can learn to be good. An “intense” (Oprah Daily), “captivating” (Today) page-turner that is also a transgressive novel of ideas about the perils of “perfect” upper-middle class parenting; the violence enacted upon women by both the state and, at times, one another; the systems that separate families; and the boundlessness of love, The School for Good Mothers introduces, in Frida, an everywoman for the ages. Using dark wit to explore the pains and joys of the deepest ties that bind us, Chan has written a modern literary classic.","pageCount":336,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00IrEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00IrEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=00IrEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Jessamine+Chan&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00IrEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"An “intense” (Oprah Daily), “captivating” (Today) page-turner that is also a transgressive novel of ideas about the perils of “perfect” upper-middle class parenting; the violence enacted upon women by both the state and, at ..."

Jones learned early on to factor “pain calculations” into every plan, every situation. Born with a rare congenital condition called sacral agenesis which affects both her stature and gait, her pain is physical. But there is also the pain of being judged and pitied for her appearance, of being dismissed as “less than.” The way she has been seen—or not seen—has informed her lens on the world her entire life. She resisted this reality by excelling academically and retreating to “the neutral room in her mind” until it passed. But after unexpectedly becoming a mother (in violation of unspoken social taboos about the disabled body), something in her shifts, and Jones sets off on a journey across the globe, reclaiming the spaces she’d been denied, and denied herself. From the bars and domestic spaces of her life in Brooklyn to sculpture gardens in Rome; from film festivals in Utah to a Beyoncé concert in Milan; from a tennis tournament in California to the Killing Fields of Phnom Penh, Jones weaves memory, observation, experience, and aesthetic philosophy to probe the myths underlying our standards of beauty and desirability and interrogates her own complicity in upholding those myths. “Bold, honest, and superbly well-written” (Andre Aciman, author of Call Me By Your Name) Easy Beauty?is the rare memoir that has the power to make you see the world, and your place in it, with new eyes.","pageCount":288,"categories":"Biography & Autobiography","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jessamine+Chan&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9aQ1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"From the bars and domestic spaces of her life in Brooklyn to sculpture gardens in Rome; from film festivals in Utah to a Beyoncé concert in Milan; from a tennis tournament in California to the Killing Fields of Phnom Penh, Jones weaves ..."

ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022—Good Housekeeping, Autostraddle, The Millions “When the Juvenile Transportation Services come for you in the night in a preordained kidnapping, complete with an unmarked van and husky guardsmen you can’t outmatch, you have been sold for a promise.” A young woman thinks she has escaped her past only to discover that she’s been hovering on its edges all along: She and her younger sister bide their time in a dilapidated warehouse in a desolate town north of New York City; their parents settled there with dreams of starting an art commune. But after the girls’ father vanishes, all traces of stability disappear for the family, and the girls retreat into strange worlds of their own mythmaking and isolation. As the sisters both try to survive their increasingly dark and dangerous adolescences, they break apart and reunite repeatedly, orbiting each other like planets. Both endure stints at the Veld Center, a wilderness camp where troubled teenage girls are sent as a last resort, and both emerge more deeply warped by the harsh outdoor survival experiences they must endure and the attempts by staff to break them down psychologically.

  "id":"cik3EAAAQBAJ","title":"Lessons in Chemistry","author":"Bonnie Garmus","publisher":"Doubleday Canada","publishedDate":"2022-03-29","description":"A delight for readers of Where'd You Go, Bernadette, this blockbuster debut set in 1960s California features the singular voice of Elizabeth Zott, a scientist whose career takes a detour when she becomes the star of a beloved TV cooking show. Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it's the 1960s and despite the fact that she is a scientist, her peers are very unscientific when it comes to equality. The only good thing to happen to her on the road to professional fulfillment is a run-in with her super-star colleague Calvin Evans (well, she stole his beakers). The only man who ever treated her—and her ideas—as equal, Calvin is already a legend and Nobel nominee. He's also awkward, kind and tenacious. Theirs is true chemistry. But as events are never as predictable as chemical reactions, three years later Elizabeth Zott is an unwed, single mother (did we mention it's the early 60s?) and the star of America's most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth's singular approach to cooking (\"take one pint of H2O and add a pinch of sodium chloride\") and independent example are proving revolutionary. Because Elizabeth isn't just teaching women how to cook, she's teaching them how to change the status quo. Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters (including the best canine character in years), Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.","pageCount":400,"categories":"Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cik3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cik3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=cik3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Bonnie+Garmus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cik3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"She&#39;s daring them to change the status quo.

Samuel “Sooley” Sooleymon is a raw, young talent with big hoop dreams—and even bigger challenges off the court. “Hard to put down ... the pages turn quickly ... building to a climax that won’t leave readers doubting whether this is a John Grisham novel.” —Associated Press In the summer of his seventeenth year, Sam­uel Sooleymon gets the chance of a lifetime: a trip to the United States with his South Sudanese teammates to play in a showcase basket­ball tournament. He has never been away from home, nor has he ever been on an airplane. The opportunity to be scouted by dozens of college coaches is a dream come true. Samuel is an amazing athlete, with speed, quick­ness, and an astonishing vertical leap. The rest of his game, though, needs work, and the American coaches are less than impressed. During the tournament, Samuel receives dev­astating news from home: A civil war is raging across South Sudan, and rebel troops have ran­sacked his village. His father is dead, his sister is missing, and his mother and two younger brothers are in a refugee camp. Samuel desperately wants to go home, but it’s just not possible. Partly out of sympathy, the coach of North Carolina Central offers him a scholar­ship. Samuel moves to Durham, enrolls in classes, joins the team, and prepares to sit out his freshman season. There is plenty of more mature talent and he isn’t immediately needed. But Samuel has something no other player has: a fierce determination to succeed so he can bring his family to America. He works tirelessly on his game, shooting baskets every morning at dawn by himself in the gym, and soon he’s dominating everyone in practice. With the Central team los­ing and suffering injury after injury, Sooley, as he is nicknamed, is called off the bench. And the legend begins. But how far can Sooley take his team? And will success allow him to save his family? Gripping and moving, Sooley showcases John Grisham’s unparalleled storytelling powers in a whole new light.

In his first collection of novellas, law is a common thread, but America’s favorite storyteller has several surprises in store. “Homecoming” takes us back to Ford County, the fictional setting of many of John Grisham’s unforgettable stories. Jake Brigance is back, but he’s not in the courtroom. He’s called upon to help an old friend, Mack Stafford, a former lawyer in Clanton, who three years earlier became a local legend when he stole money from his clients, divorced his wife, filed for bankruptcy, and left his family in the middle of the night, never to be heard from again—until now. Now Mack is back, and he’s leaning on his old pals, Jake and Harry Rex, to help him return. His homecoming does not go as planned. In “Strawberry Moon,” we meet Cody Wallace, a young death row inmate only three hours away from execution. His lawyers can’t save him, the courts slam the door, and the governor says no to a last-minute request for clemency. As the clock winds down, Cody has one final request. The “Sparring Partners” are the Malloy brothers, Kirk and Rusty, two successful young lawyers who inherited a once prosperous firm when its founder, their father, was sent to prison. Kirk and Rusty loathe each other, and speak to each other only when necessary. As the firm disintegrates, the resulting fiasco falls into the lap of Diantha Bradshaw, the only person the partners trust. Can she save the Malloys, or does she take a stand for the first time in her career and try to save herself?

Then there are the visits from the kind but mysterious apparition she calls \"Grandmother,\" who tells her, \"You have three months to save him.\" The next night, under the stadium lights of the high school football field, she meets a beautiful boy named Beau, and it's as if time just stops and nothing exists. Nothing, except Natalie and Beau.","pageCount":400,"categories":"Young Adult Fiction","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-PKVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-PKVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=-PKVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Emily+Henry&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-PKVCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"&quot;A truly profound debut.&quot;—Buzzfeed &quot;A time-bending suspense that&#39;s contemplative and fresh, evocative and gripping.&quot;—USA Today &quot;Henry&#39;s story captivates, both as a romance and as an imaginative rethinking of time and space. ..."

Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast. They're polar opposites. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel.

Henry's writing will leave you breathless.\" —BuzzFeed Romeo and Juliet meets One Hundred Years of Solitude in Emily Henry's brilliant follow-up to The Love That Split the World, about the daughter and son of two long-feuding families who fall in love while trying to uncover the truth about the strange magic and harrowing curse that has plagued their bloodlines for generations. In their hometown of Five Fingers, Michigan, the O'Donnells and the Angerts have mythic legacies. But for all the tall tales they weave, both founding families are tight-lipped about what caused the century-old rift between them, except to say it began with a cherry tree. Eighteen-year-old Jack “June” O’Donnell doesn't need a better reason than that. She's an O'Donnell to her core, just like her late father was, and O'Donnells stay away from Angerts. Period. But when Saul Angert, the son of June's father's mortal enemy, returns to town after three mysterious years away, June can't seem to avoid him. Soon the unthinkable happens: She finds she doesn't exactly hate the gruff, sarcastic boy she was born to loathe. Saul’s arrival sparks a chain reaction, and as the magic, ghosts, and coywolves of Five Fingers conspire to reveal the truth about the dark moment that started the feud, June must question everything she knows about her family and the father she adored.

If you weren't a casualty of the accident yourself, chances are a loved one was. That's the case for seventeen-year-old Franny, who, five years after the explosion, still has to stand by and do nothing as her brother lies in a coma.

The group calls themselves The Ordinary, and they spend their free time investigating local ghost stories and legends, filming their exploits for their small following of YouTube fans. It's silly, it's fun, and it keeps them from dwelling on the sadness that surrounds them.

Finally, Ina’s desserts never disappoint—from Red Velvet Cupcakes to Chocolate Pudding Cream Tart. To top it all off, Ina also shares her best tips for making cooking really easy. She leaves bowls of lemons and limes on the counter not only because they look great but because they also remind her that a squeeze of lemon in a dish brightens the flavors.

Tomato soup is created from oven-roasted tomatoes and fresh basil to intensify the flavors.

Psychologists and neuroscientists refer to these distinctly human foibles, biases, and thinking traps as “cognitive errors.” Cognitive errors are systematic deviances from rationality, from optimized, logical, rational thinking and behavior. We make these errors all the time, in all sorts of situations, for problems big and small: whether to choose the apple or the cupcake; whether to keep retirement funds in the stock market when the Dow tanks, or whether to take the advice of a friend over a stranger. </p><p>The “behavioral turn” in neuroscience and economics in the past twenty years has increased our understanding of how we think and how we make decisions. It shows how systematic errors mar our thinking and under which conditions our thought processes work best and worst. Evolutionary psychology delivers convincing theories about why our thinking is, in fact, marred. The neurosciences can pinpoint with increasing precision what exactly happens when we think clearly and when we don’t.</p><p>Drawing on this wide body of research, The Art of Thinking Clearly is an entertaining presentation of these known systematic thinking errors--offering guidance and insight into everything why you shouldn’t accept a free drink to why you SHOULD walk out of a movie you don’t like it to why it’s so hard to predict the future to why shouldn’t watch the news. The book is organized into 100 short chapters, each covering a single cognitive error, bias, or heuristic. Examples of these concepts include: Reciprocity, Confirmation Bias, The It-Gets-Better-Before-It-Gets-Worse Trap, and the Man-With-A-Hammer Tendency. In engaging prose and with real-world examples and anecdotes, The Art of Thinking Clearly helps solve the puzzle of human reasoning. </p>","pageCount":384,"categories":"Psychology / Cognitive Psychology & Cognition","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72Z-PdRFaAR2I8eH-wr8LGrawMlmlIB2EIxQZfH1iZhpB0UV5wAQ5AZpLKtcv9JWK2KzclUcN9gIwDSTscEXgOfvumSPemD6mjVCWyfFFjgXsvXHN6LHEYJjMCtIB0vZJYsJdEr&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73jVLXB-1g0r5y-MbyTk9KPxiXbmZFZYrwBLI0UHO5dRgQW6N58HpIVv-0P9OLKxp7HK4gO2H1_AQvEWd569OLGIiB60X0WUCsHnMtfjqluFIjnmIljstyiBo5tEMQgcS1cS4aR&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"

In this fascinating, revelatory work, Helena Kelly--dazzling Jane Austen authority--looks past the grand houses, the pretty young women, past the demure drawing room dramas and witty commentary on the narrow social worlds of her time that became the hallmark of Austen's work to bring to light the serious, ambitious, deeply subversive nature of this beloved writer. Kelly illuminates the radical subjects--slavery, poverty, feminism, the Church, evolution, among them--considered treasonous at the time, that Austen deftly explored in the six novels that have come to embody an age. The author reveals just how in the novels we find the real Jane Austen: a clever, clear-sighted woman \"of information,\" fully aware of what was going on in the world and sure about what she thought of it. We see a writer who understood that the novel--until then seen as mindless \"trash\"--could be a great art form and who, perhaps more than any other writer up to that time, imbued it with its particular greatness.","pageCount":338,"categories":"Biography & Autobiography","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bvdQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bvdQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=bvdQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=bvdQDwAAQBAJ&dq=Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api","searchInfo":"In this fascinating, revelatory work, Helena Kelly--dazzling Jane Austen authority--looks past the grand houses, the pretty young women, past the demure drawing room dramas and witty commentary on the narrow social worlds of her time that ..."

The eldest of the bennett family, elizabeth, is a bright, opinionated, and complacent young woman whose reaction to an offer of marriage from her wealthy but impossibly arrogant suitor, fitzwilliam darcy, is revulsion.","pageCount":376,"categories":"Fiction / Classics","imageSmall":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5GbdTc9OJ78C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73u9fNjy7O3xe1AhlNJlFOKfaxisJTDq3ycjuBcPpqXzF6o6Px1ljP7L1strlGiIGL3MMdxphIqbiZBCeHZEBy62xZkhny3m5yHu9HXZOk6GCXFXxg4Oe_90D6U6xrbJuSFfj63&source=gbs_api","image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5GbdTc9OJ78C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72W0UcH9ffrRdxLlnv8YbOabNc4R16JjIa63XNQF5F9b6V0W5SQ1i8w4_bpNa_XgqC_Ax7Ef9LToJHM2HnuWtOEL3ee1CE-M77qH7gBG0sTyM5FLTFhRdiVANXWvYOFn52VseMt&source=gbs_api","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=5GbdTc9OJ78C&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5GbdTc9OJ78C&source=gbs_api"
